# Supported Platforms

## Verification status

The seL4 proofs are only for specific platforms, as noted in the tables for x86 and ARM below, in
the *Status* column, as follows:

* Unverified: this platform is not verfied at all and is not scheduled for verification.
* Pending: this feature is currently undergoing verification.
* FC: the functional correctness proofs are complete.
* FCI: the integrity proofs are complete, in addition to functional correctness.
* Verified: all proofs for this platform are complete, including functional correctness, integrity and infoflow.

## Simulating seL4

Running seL4 in a simulator is a quick way to test it out and iteratively develop software. However,
note that feature support is limited by the simulator.

See [Running It](/seL4Test#RunningIt) for how to run seL4 using Qemu.

## x86

We support PC99-style Intel Architecture Platforms.

## ARM

seL4 has support for select ARMv6, ARMv7 and ARMv8 Platforms.

## RISC-V

We currently provide a prototype support for the 64-bit RISC-V spike platform. See [Simulating RISC-V](RISCV). Floating point unit (FPU) are not supported. Boards with SMP label support multicore.
